### Checking Logs

```bash
# View recent logs
tail -f /var/log/music-player/music_player.log

# View system service logs
journalctl -u music-player -f

# View last 50 log entries
journalctl -u music-player -n 50

# View logs for specific date
journalctl -u music-player --since "2024-01-01" --until "2024-01-02"
```

## Security Tips

### File Permissions

```bash
# Set proper permissions for the executable
sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/music-player

# Secure the config file
sudo chmod 644 /etc/music-player/music_player.conf
sudo chown root:root /etc/music-player/music_player.conf

# Set log directory permissions
sudo chmod 775 /var/log/music-player
sudo chown user:adm /var/log/music-player
```

### Running as Non-Root

Always run the music player as a regular user, not root:

```bash
# Create a dedicated user for the service
sudo useradd -r -s /bin/false musicplayer

# Update systemd service to use the dedicated user
sudo systemctl edit music-player.service
```

### Network Security

If running as a service, consider:
- Firewall rules if exposing any network interfaces
- Running in a restricted environment or container
- Regular security updates for mpg123 and system packages
