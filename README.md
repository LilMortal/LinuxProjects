- Basic command-line tools (curl, wget, git)

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/LilMortal/LinuxProjects.git
cd LinuxProjects

# Make scripts executable
find . -name "*.sh" -exec chmod +x {} \;

# Run the setup script (if available)
./setup.sh
```

### Individual Project Usage
Each project directory contains its own README with specific installation and usage instructions:

```bash
# Navigate to specific project
cd scripts/system-monitor/

# Read project-specific documentation
cat README.md

# Execute the script
./monitor.sh
```

## üìã Requirements

### System Requirements
- **OS**: Linux (tested on Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian)
- **Memory**: Minimum 512MB RAM
- **Storage**: Varies by project (typically 10MB-1GB)
- **Network**: Internet connection for updates and external dependencies

### Software Dependencies
- `bash` (‚â• 4.0)
- `systemd` (for service management scripts)
- `cron` (for scheduled tasks)
- `curl` or `wget` (for download scripts)
- `jq` (for JSON processing, where applicable)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables
Set the following environment variables for optimal functionality:

```bash

export LOG_LEVEL="INFO"  # DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
export BACKUP_DESTINATION="/backup/location"
export NOTIFICATION_EMAIL="admin@example.com"
```

### Configuration Files
Main configuration file: `config/main.conf`

```bash
# Copy example configuration
cp config/main.conf.example config/main.conf

# Edit configuration
nano config/main.conf
```

chmod +x script-name.sh

# Run with sudo if needed
sudo ./script-name.sh
```

**Missing Dependencies**
```bash
# Install required packages (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install curl wget jq

# Install required packages (CentOS/RHEL)
sudo yum install curl wget jq
```

**Configuration Issues**
