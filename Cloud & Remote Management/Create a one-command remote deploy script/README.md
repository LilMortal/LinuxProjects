# RemoteDeploy - One-Command Remote Deployment System

A comprehensive web-based deployment management system that provides a beautiful interface for managing and executing remote deployments with one command.

## Overview

RemoteDeploy is a full-stack application that combines a React frontend with a Node.js backend to provide enterprise-grade deployment capabilities. It allows you to manage multiple servers, configure deployment pipelines, and execute deployments with comprehensive logging and monitoring.

## Features

- **üéØ One-Command Deployment**: Execute complex deployment workflows with a single click
- **üñ•Ô∏è Beautiful Web Interface**: Modern, responsive UI with real-time updates
- **üîß Server Management**: Add, configure, and monitor multiple deployment targets
- **üìä Deployment History**: Track all deployments with detailed logs and status
- **üîç Real-time Logging**: Comprehensive logging system with filtering and search
- **üîê SSH Integration**: Secure connections using SSH keys or passwords
- **‚öôÔ∏è Flexible Configuration**: Support for pre/post-deploy commands, service restarts, and environment variables
- **üì± Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## Requirements

### System Requirements
- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04+ (or any standard Linux distribution)
- **Node.js**: 18.0 or higher
- **npm**: 8.0 or higher
- **Git**: 2.0 or higher

### Server Requirements (for deployment targets)
- SSH access with key-based or password authentication
- Git installed on target servers
- Appropriate permissions for deployment directories
- `systemctl` access for service management (if using service restart features)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/remote-deploy-system.git
cd remote-deploy-system
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install all dependencies (frontend and backend)
npm install
```

### 3. Create Required Directories
```bash
# Create logs directory
mkdir -p logs

# Create SSH keys directory (optional)
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
```

### 4. Build the Frontend
```bash
npm run build
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory (optional):

```bash
# Server Configuration
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=production

# Logging Configuration
LOG_LEVEL=info
LOG_FILE_PATH=./logs/combined.log

# Security Configuration (for future use)
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret-here
```

### SSH Key Setup (Recommended)
For secure, password-less deployments, set up SSH keys:

```bash
# Generate SSH key pair
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your-email@example.com"

# Copy public key to target servers
ssh-copy-id user@your-server.com
```

## Usage

### Starting the Application

#### Development Mode
```bash
# Start both frontend and backend in development
npm run dev

# Or start them separately
npm run server  # Backend only
npm run dev     # Frontend only (in another terminal)
```

#### Production Mode
```bash
# Build and start the production server
npm run build
npm run server
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3001`

### Basic Deployment Workflow

1. **Add Servers**: Navigate to the "Servers" tab and add your deployment targets
2. **Test Connections**: Use the "Test Connection" button to verify SSH access
3. **Configure Deployment**: Go to the "Deploy" tab and configure your deployment:
   - Select target server
   - Enter repository URL and branch
   - Configure build commands and deployment path
   - Set up pre/post-deploy commands
   - Define environment variables and services to restart
4. **Execute Deployment**: Click "Deploy Now" to start the deployment
5. **Monitor Progress**: Watch real-time logs and deployment status
6. **Review History**: Check the "History" tab for deployment records

### Example Deployment Configuration

```json
{
  "serverId": "server-123",
  "repositoryUrl": "https://github.com/user/my-app.git",
  "branch": "main",
  "buildCommand": "npm install && npm run build",
  "deployPath": "/var/www/html/my-app",
  "preDeployCommands": [
    "sudo systemctl stop nginx"
  ],
  "postDeployCommands": [
    "npm install --production",
    "chmod +x scripts/setup.sh",
    "./scripts/setup.sh"
  ],
  "backupBeforeDeploy": true,
  "restartServices": ["nginx", "pm2"],
  "environmentVariables": {
    "NODE_ENV": "production",
    "API_URL": "https://api.example.com"
  }
}
```

## Automation

### Systemd Service (Recommended)

Create a systemd service file for automatic startup:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/remote-deploy.service
```

```ini
[Unit]
Description=RemoteDeploy Service
After=network.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=1
User=deploy
WorkingDirectory=/opt/remote-deploy
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node server/index.js
Environment=NODE_ENV=production
Environment=PORT=3001

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start the service:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable remote-deploy
sudo systemctl start remote-deploy
```

### Cron Job Alternative

For scheduled deployments, you can set up cron jobs:

```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add entries (example: deploy every day at 2 AM)
0 2 * * * curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/deploy -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @/path/to/deploy-config.json
```

### Docker Deployment

Create a `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

COPY . .
RUN npm run build

EXPOSE 3001

USER node

CMD ["npm", "run", "server"]
```

Build and run:
```bash
docker build -t remote-deploy .
docker run -d -p 3001:3001 -v ./logs:/app/logs remote-deploy
```

## Logging

### Log Locations
- **Application Logs**: `./logs/combined.log`
- **Error Logs**: `./logs/error.log`
- **Console Output**: Real-time during development

### Log Levels
- **error**: Critical errors and failures
- **warn**: Warning messages and non-critical issues
- **info**: General information and successful operations
- **debug**: Detailed debugging information

### Viewing Logs

#### Through Web Interface
Navigate to the "Logs" tab in the application for:
- Real-time log viewing
- Filtering by log level
- Search functionality
- Log download capabilities

#### Command Line
```bash
# View all logs
tail -f logs/combined.log

# View only errors
tail -f logs/error.log

# Filter logs by deployment
grep "deployment" logs/combined.log

# View systemd service logs (if using systemd)
sudo journalctl -u remote-deploy -f
```

## Security Tips

### SSH Security
- **Use SSH Keys**: Always prefer SSH key authentication over passwords
- **Restrict Key Permissions**: Set proper file permissions on SSH keys
  ```bash
  chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  ```
- **Use Dedicated Deployment Keys**: Create separate SSH keys for deployment purposes

### Server Security
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only necessary permissions to deployment users
- **Firewall Configuration**: Restrict SSH access to specific IP addresses
- **Regular Updates**: Keep target servers updated with security patches
- **Monitor Access**: Regularly review deployment logs for suspicious activity

### Application Security
- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive data in environment variables, not code
- **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS in production environments
- **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization (future enhancement)
- **Input Validation**: Validate all deployment configurations

### Network Security
```bash
# Example: Restrict SSH access with iptables
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -s YOUR_IP_ADDRESS -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j DROP
```
